A popular breakfast dish in Cambodia, Kuyteav can be found at marketplace stalls, roadside vendors, restaurants and in shophouses across the country, and is distinguished by its clear broth and array of herbs, aromatics and other garnishes and condiments.</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        <div class=\"r1-main\">\r\n          <p class=\"block\">Kuyteav is prepared with partially dry thin squarish rice noodles cooked by quickly immersing the noodles in boiling water. The noodles are then strained, placed into a bowl, and moistened with nutty, caramelised garlic oil. After dressing with a sticky brown liquid made of oyster sauce[citation needed], soy sauce and a pinch of sugar, the bowl is then filled with a clear broth made from pork bones, dried squid[citation needed], and sugar, and seasoned with a bit of fish sauce. Then the meat toppings are added, which may include an assembly of different types of meat, such as pork loaf, minced pork, pork belly, duck, seafood or offal. Availability is the main factor in what toppings are used in kuyteav; some versions can be quite humble and basic, using only some ground pork and perhaps some dried shrimp for protein, while others can be more time-consuming and extravagant. Finally, when the dish is presented at the table, the diner may add a number of garnishes and aromatics to customise the dish in accordance with his or her preferences.\r\n            Moreover, kuyteav may be presented in one of two ways: with all the ingredients in the soup, or with the soup on the side. Both versions can have exactly the same ingredients but allow the diner to control the balance of flavours, spiciness and textures. When the dish is served this way (“dry” as opposed to “wet”) the dish takes on the appearance of a noodle salad. Finally, the Phnom Penh version of kuyteav is the most extravagant and features the most embellishments, owing to the city's historical wealth and importance. Kuyteav Phnom Penh may contain some or all of the following toppings: sliced pork belly, ground pork, pig's blood jelly, chopped pork offal (such as intestine, heart, liver and lung), roast duck, Mekong River prawns, sliced fish cake and squid</p>\r\n        </div>\r\n        \r\n    </div>\r\n    <div class=\"flex flex-dir-r flex-jc-sb\">\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h3>Ingredients</h3>\r\n        <ul class=\"recipe\">\r\n          <li>Noodles</li>\r\n          <li>Flavor</li>\r\n          <li>Good cooks</li>\r\n          <li>People to eat it</li>\r\n          <li>Hoison and Sriracha</li>\r\n      </ul>\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>\r\n        <h3>Steps to make Kuy Teav</h3>\r\n        <ol class=\"recipe\">\r\n          <li>Boil water</li>\r\n          <li>Add all ingredients to the pot</li>\r\n          <li>Let all the flavors extract (so wait awhile)</li>\r\n          <li>Invite the homies over and bring beer</li>\r\n          <li>Once it's finished prepare some bowls</li>\r\n          <li>Can be prepared with soup or as dry bowl (iykyk)</li>\r\n          <li>Enjoy with friends and fam</li>\r\n      </ol>\r\n      </div>\r\n    </div>            \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n    \r\n  </div>  \r\n</main>    \r\n</body>\r\n</html>"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"cab257582bd115d4fcd68f7d5319e8de","cacheData":{}}
